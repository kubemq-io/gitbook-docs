# Authentication

## How Authentication Work

Clients Authentication connectivity When a client connects to Kubemq and before it can perform operations, it must authenticate, that is, present and prove its identity.

The way Kubemq authenticate the client identity is the support JWT \(Jason Web Token\) authentication.

Every request to must present a valid JWT token \(generated by any JWT provider\) and verified by public key which configured in Kubemq.

## Authentication Configuration

Kubemq's JWT support require two parameters:

1. Public Key  
2. Public Key Signature type

Each signing method expects a different object type for its signing keys. Here are the supported ones:

* The HMAC signing method - (`HS256`,`HS384`,`HS512`).
* The RSA signing method -  (`RS256`,`RS384`,`RS512`).
* The ECDSA signing method - (`ES256`,`ES384`,`ES512`).
