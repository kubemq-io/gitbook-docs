  KubeMQ resources.

# Authorization

## How Permission Work

When a client wants to perform an operation such as send data to a channel, subscribe to a channel, pull messages from a queue, KubeMQ server checks whether the client has the permission to access the relevant resources and the action. The client must have been granted the appropriate permission rule to complete the operation.

Access control permission rule consists of 4 objects:

1. Source - the client\_id of each message or request
2. Resource Type - Events, EventsStore, Queues, Commands, Queries
3. Resource Name - Channel
4. Action - Read, Write

## Authorization Configuration

### Access Control Permission Record

An access control permission record consists of 8 fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ClientID | string | Client ID - regular expression |
| Events | bool | Allow access to events, true/false |
| EventsStore | bool | Allow access to events\_store, true/false |
| Queues | bool | Allow access to queues, true/false |
| Commands | bool | Allow access to commands, true/false |
| Queries | bool | Allow access to queries, true/false |
| Channel | string | Channel name - regular expression |
| Read | bool | Allow reading from a resource \(i.e., subscribe to a channel\), true/false |
| Write | bool | Allow writing to a resource \(i.e., send message to a channel\), true/false |

The regular expressions for ClientID and Channel allow great flexibility for access control permissions. Let's see some examples.

For ClientID :

| ClientID Regular Expression | Will Grant Access To |
| :--- | :--- |
| client-redis | clients with client\_id = 'client-redis' |
| client\* | any client\_id start with 'client' |
| .\* | any client\_id |

For Channel:

| Channel Regular Expression | Will Grant Access To |
| :--- | :--- |
| foo.bar | Channel = 'foo.bar' |
| foo.bar\* | Any channel starts with foo.bar |
| .\* | Any channel |

### Access Control Permission Rules Set

An array of access control permission records form an access control permission rules set. Every operation will check against all the records in the rules set. To grant access to a resource, at least one rule must meet the permission requirements.

### Examples

#### Grant access only to client-a to Events resource, both read and write to any channel

```javascript
[
   {
      "ClientID":"client-a",
      "Events":true,
      "EventsStore": false,
      "Queues": false,
      "Commands": false,
      "Queries": flase,
      "Channel":".*",
      "Read":true,
      "Write":true
   }
]
```

#### Grant access to all client ids starts with sub. to all resources only for reading from foo.bar channel

```javascript
[
   {
      "ClientID":"sub.*",
      "Events":true,
      "EventsStore": true,
      "Queues": true,
      "Commands": true,
      "Queries": true,
      "Channel":"foo.bar",
      "Read":true,
      "Write": false
   }
]
```

Grant access for client-1 to send events only to foo.bar.1 and client-2 to send only to foo.bar.2

```javascript
[
   {
      "ClientID":"client-1",
      "Events":true,
      "EventsStore": false,
      "Queues": false,
      "Commands": false,
      "Queries": false,
      "Channel":"foo.bar.1",
      "Read":false,
      "Write": true
   },
   {
      "ClientID":"client-2",
      "Events":true,
      "EventsStore": false,
      "Queues": false,
      "Commands": false,
      "Queries": false,
      "Channel":"foo.bar.2",
      "Read":false,
      "Write": true
   },

]
```

## Loading Configuration

Kubemq supports two configuration loading options:

1. Set json array on cluster creation
2. Set Url of a web service to call and get Authorization configuration json array with automatic reloading options every predefined second

{% page-ref page="../../configuration/cluster/set-authorization.md" %}

{% hint style="success" %}
The authorization feature is available only on Kubemq Enterprise Edition.
